[ 6/19/25 ]
- New Feature: Sandbox option so that Power is required for shops.
   This should not prevent owners from stocking or managing their stores, only purchases.

- New Feature: [Experimental] Shops now track their assigned locations.
   This system is to support wipes/resets to speed up the process of setting up shops.
   The only way to modify the locations is through editing and loading the exported textfile.
   The way the system works is taking right click on tiles and compares them to the shops list.
   Tracking occurs whenever a shop is assigned (or visited to support previous setups).
   If there are performance concerns or drops, visiting the shops once and toggling the sandbox option is fine.

- Fix: Splitting/Place in Wallet now better supports multiple items selected at once.
   Split only applies to the first item found in the selection.
   Place in Wallet will apply to each item.

- Tweaks/Improvements:
   Changes to how wallet logic is handled.
   Changes to how context menus are handled.
